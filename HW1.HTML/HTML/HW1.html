            <h1> first fact</h1>
            
            <p >Pineapples, scientifically classified as Ananas comosus, exhibit a truly intriguing growth pattern. As members of the Bromeliaceae family,
                they undergo a distinctive reproductive process. The pineapple plant produces a central flower spike with multiple small flowers,
                each capable of developing into an individual fruit. Over time, these individual fruits cluster together, forming the characteristic 
                composite structure we recognize as a pineapple. This phenomenon showcases the complexity
                of botanical development and highlights the unique biological features that make pineapples stand out among fruits.Contrary to popular belief, pineapples are not a single fruit but a cluster of individual berries that fuse together
                around a central core. Each "eye" on the pineapple's surface represents a separate flower that eventually 
                forms an individual fruit, and these fruits merge as they grow, creating the characteristic composite structure.

            <h1 >secound fact</h1>
            <P> Pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain, which is a natural meat tenderizer.
                Bromelain breaks down proteins, making it effective in tenderizing tough cuts of meat. This enzyme is often used in marinades 
                for meats and can be particularly helpful in preparing dishes like
                pineapple-marinated grilled chicken.</P>

                <h1 >Third fact </h1>
                <p>: Unlike some fruits that continue to ripen after being picked, pineapples do not.
                    Once harvested, their sugar content and flavor remain constant. So, it's crucial 
                    to choose a ripe pineapple at the time of purchase since it won't get any sweeter or more flavorful 
                    as it sits on your kitchen counter. </p>

                <h1> fourth fact</h1>
                <p>  Bromelain, the enzyme found in pineapples, not only helps tenderize meat but also possesses
                    anti-inflammatory properties. Some studies suggest that bromelain may have potential benefits 
                    in reducing inflammation and relieving symptoms of conditions like osteoarthritis. However,
                    it's important to note that the amount of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple may not 
                    be sufficient for therapeutic effects, and concentrated supplements are often used for such purposes.
